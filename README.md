# StockScrapingProject

## Stack used for this project
### Python 3.7
### MySQL

## Objective
The objective of this project was to extract live stock price data from various sources such as NASDAQ, Reuters, Yahoo Finance to name a few. This is done via web scraping
and by the use of REST APIs. Once data was extracted, all the necessary preprocessing steps were taken in order to have them properly and efficiently stored locally into CSVs
as well as into MySQL database for further analysis.

## Future implementation of this project
The future implementation of this project would be to use historical stock price data in order to run it through several supervised and unsupervised machine learning
algorithms in order to make future stock price predictions for the upcoming quarter.
